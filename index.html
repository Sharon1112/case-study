                <p  id="lens">Google Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you’re looking at and use that 
                    information to copy or translate text, identify plants and animals, explore locales or menus, discover products, find visually 
                    similar images, and take other useful actions.
                    Lens always tries to return the most relevant and useful results. Lens’ algorithms aren’t affected by advertisements or other 
                    commercial arrangements. When Lens returns results from other Google products, including Google Search or Shopping, the results 
                    rely on the ranking algorithms of those products.

                <p id="mobilenet">Mobilenet basically serves the same purpose as google lens which is identification of objects. The Webapp I have created uses MobileNet. MobileNet is a nerual network which has lesser limits to its functioning and it also has a higher
                    classification accuracy. The textbook defination of MobileNet is as follows,MobileNet is a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to construct lightweight deep convolutional neural networks and provides an efficient model for mobile and embedded vision applications.
                    This means that the structure of MobileNet is based on depthwise separable fliters. The depthwise convolution filter performs a single convolution on each input channel.
                    A convolution is a basic mathemaical operation which is used in many image processing operators. Convolution basically 'multiplies' two arrays of numbers of different sizes, but of the same dimensionality, to produce a third array of numbers of the same dimensionality.
